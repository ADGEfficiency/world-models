idea of doing a one to one mapping of my code base to paper code

temperature memory, use in dream

do a gif of episode 0, episode half (100?)

training in dream = less computation

what did i learn
- minimization of lower bound

put key / important references everywhere
images & examples for everything! (draw on the whiteboard?)

pre knowledge - conditional, marginal distributions, kld, 

scope!
- baselines
- doom

enjoyed working with images

ecosystem
